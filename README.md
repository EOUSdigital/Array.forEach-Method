# üìò Module 06 - JavaScript: Loops, Iteration, and High-Order Array Methods

## üìö Lesson Overview
This lesson explores the foundational and high-level iteration mechanisms in JavaScript, including classic loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`) and modern high-order array methods such as `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.

---

## üìù Step 1: Theoretical Aspects

### A. What is Iteration?
Iteration is the process of repeating a set of instructions. In JavaScript, it‚Äôs how we process data structures like arrays or objects.

### B. Loop Types
- `for`, `while`, `do...while`
- `for...in` (for object keys)
- `for...of` (for iterable values)

### C. High-Order Array Methods
- `.forEach()`: performs actions for each element, no return value
- `.map()`: transforms each item, returns a new array
- `.filter()`: filters items based on a condition
- `.reduce()`: reduces all items into a single output value

---

## üîç Step 2: Inquiry & Application

### Exploration Prompts
- Trade-offs between `for` vs `.map()`
- Difference between `.filter()` and `.forEach()`
- Use cases for `.reduce()` over chaining

### Hands-On Examples
- Looping through numbers divisible by 3
- Filtering even numbers
- Counting word frequency with `.reduce()`

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Assessment & Feedback

Includes a 10-question multiple choice quiz, coding challenges, refactoring practice, and reflection on method selection and optimization.

---

## üîÅ Step 4: Reflection & Discussion

Guided prompts:
- When to prefer classic loops
- Intuitiveness of methods
- Strengths of `.reduce()` in simplifying logic

Includes journal entry: using `.reduce()` for object transformation.

---

## üß© Step 5: Exercises

### Starter
- Odd number generator
- Double values using `.map()`
- Get string lengths

### Intermediate
- Filter even numbers
- Capitalize usernames
- Filter active users
- Calculate total cart value

### Advanced
- Flatten 2D arrays with `.reduce()`
- Group by category
- Frequency counter

### Bonus
- Chain `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.reduce()` for a custom cart calculation

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 6: Project Integration

**To-Do App**:
- Use `.filter()` to get completed tasks
- Use `.map()` to display task list
- Use `.reduce()` to count remaining

**Shopping Cart**:
- Filter in-stock items
- Map formatted HTML
- Reduce to calculate total

---

## üßæ Step 7: Exit Ticket Reflection

**Key Takeaway**: High-order methods enhance readability, functionality, and performance.

**Area for Practice**: `.reduce()` ‚Äî especially in advanced transformations.

**Concept Summary**:
- `.forEach()`: for side effects
- `.map()`: for transformation
- `.reduce()`: for accumulation
